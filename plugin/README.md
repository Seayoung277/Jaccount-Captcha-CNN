# Jaccount Captcha Chrome Plugin

## Description
These are the Chome plugin source files. The packed plugin file `JaccountCaptcha.crx` is also provided. In this version, single letter recognizing accuracy is about 0.99. 

## Guide
I provided two trained network models in this folder, and `model_1.js` is used by default. To use the other one, you can modify the `manifest.json` file or just change the model file name to `model_1.js` and repack the plugin.
